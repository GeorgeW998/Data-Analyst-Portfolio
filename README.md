# Project: Analysis of Powerlifting Dataset

## Background
I have taken a data analytics course where the final project was to choose and analyse a dataset with our own hypothesis. With the idea of using all of the the skills and techniques I learnt like: cleaning, manipulating, querying and visualising. Then compile the process and my findings into a easy-to-understand presentation.
And I chose this particular dataset as it was large (~2.5million rows), but mainly because I love the sport. :)

## Hypothesis
To see if factors such as a lifter age or gender or bodyweight contributes to a higher lifted total. 

## Overview 
- Did some cleaning and organising to columns
- I condensed the data down by a few parameters to leave more comaprable data
- Grouped and sorted the data into categories to relate them, to test the hypothesis
- Used different visualisation methods to display the relationships.

## Improvements 
This is still a work in progress, so I will be adding and improving as I learn.

- Add some machine learning which will try to predict peoples' total max lift, based on the previously mentioned factors.
- Look at failed lifts and see if/how far these would be outside a persons max.
- Some general neatening of the notebook for ease of reading.
